to generate a ssh key pairs ==> ssh-keygen
it will generate a pair of ssh keys (private and public) in ~/.ssh directory

never share ssh private keys with anyone

to share ssh public key ==> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/key.pub  user@remote-host
user => the user of the remote machine
remote-host => remote machine's ip address
 it will ask for that users password


## ssh-agent

generate your ssh keys with passphrase. By doing this nobody can harm the system by stealing it

when using ssh-key with passpharase , everytime it will ask for passphrase when to connect

to get rid of this hassle, we use ssh-agent

$ssh-agent bash

this command will open a new bash sub-terminal with ssh-agent on 
we will use that terminal for ssh connection
we need to put the passphrase for one time when connecting to remote-host for the first time in that sub shell

when we want a break, we simply  exit that sub terminal and our cache login passphrase will be gone
