[-D [bind_address:]port]

$ ssh -D 9000 user@remote-server

we can redirect out network traffic by using user@remote-server securely with ssh
with this command we will pass our traffic through internet  securely and 
disguise ourself as user@remote-server to internet

after this command we need to change our browser's proxy settings
# socks_host to localhost and port to 9000
by doing this our network traffic will go through 
 brower ==> localhost ==> user@remote-server  ==> internet
