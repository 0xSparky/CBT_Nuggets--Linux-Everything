TCP only, vpn  with SShuttle   

- no proxy config
- routes non-web traffic
- no udp support

with ssh tunneling we can tunnel a single port's traffice to another port however
if we want to connect an entire internal network with a single ssh connection we use ssshuttle

# sudo sshuttle [options] -r [username@]sshserver[:port] <subnets â€¦>

# sudo sshuttle -r user@remote-host:2222 0.0.0.0/0
